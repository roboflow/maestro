## How to Contribute

Your contributions can be in many forms—whether it’s enhancing existing features, improving documentation, resolving bugs, or proposing new ideas. Here’s a high-level overview to get you started:

1. [Fork the Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo): Click the “Fork” button on our GitHub page to create your own copy.
2. [Clone Locally](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.11/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository): Download your fork to your local development environment.
3. [Create a Branch](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches-in-github-desktop): Use a descriptive name to create a new branch (e.g., `feature/your-descriptive-name`):
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-descriptive-name
   ```
4. Develop Your Changes: Make your updates, ensuring your commit messages clearly describe your modifications.
5. [Commit and Push](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project-in-github-desktop): Run:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "A brief description of your changes"
   git push -u origin your-descriptive-name
   ```
6. [Open a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request): Submit your pull request against the main development branch. Please detail your changes and link any related issues.

Before merging, check that all tests pass and that your changes adhere to our development and documentation standards.

## CLA Signing

In order to maintain the integrity of our project, every pull request must include a signed Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This confirms that your contributions are properly licensed under our Apache 2.0 License. After opening your pull request, simply add a comment stating:

```
I have read the CLA Document and I sign the CLA.
```

This step is essential before any merge can occur.

## Google-Style Docstrings and Mandatory Type Hints

For clarity and maintainability, any new functions or classes must include [Google-style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) and use Python type hints. Type hints are mandatory in all function definitions, ensuring explicit parameter and return type declarations. These docstrings should clearly explain parameters, return types, and provide usage examples when applicable.

For example:

```python
def sample_function(param1: int, param2: int = 10) -> bool:
    """
    Provides a brief description of function behavior.

    Args:
        param1 (int): Explanation of the first parameter.
        param2 (int): Explanation of the second parameter, defaulting to 10.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the operation succeeds, otherwise False.

    Examples:
        >>> sample_function(5, 10)
        True
    """
    return param1 == param2
```

Following this pattern helps ensure consistency throughout the codebase.

## Reporting Bugs

Bug reports are vital for continued improvement. When reporting an issue, please include a clear, minimal reproducible example that demonstrates the problem. Detailed bug reports assist us in swiftly diagnosing and addressing issues.

## Adding a New Model

If you’re contributing a new model to Maestro, please adhere to these guidelines to ensure alignment with our project structure:

- Directory Structure: Create a dedicated folder under the `models/` directory (e.g., `models/your_model/`). Your folder should mirror the structure seen in existing models, including:
  - `core.py`: Implements the primary logic of the model.
  - `loaders.py`: Manages data ingestion and preprocessing.
  - `checkpoints.py`: Handles saving and loading model checkpoints.
  - `inference.py`: Contains the functions for running predictions.
  - `entrypoint.py`: Provides the integration interface for the model.

- Dependencies: Update the [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/roboflow/maestro/blob/develop/pyproject.toml) file with any new dependencies needed by your model.
- Documentation: Add a dedicated page for your model under the `docs/` directory and update the main docs index ([`docs/index.md`](https://github.com/roboflow/maestro/blob/develop/docs/index.md)). For style guidance, refer to pages like [`florence_2.md`](https://github.com/roboflow/maestro/blob/develop/docs/models/florence_2.md), [`paligemma_2.md`](https://github.com/roboflow/maestro/blob/develop/docs/models/paligemma_2.md), or [`qwen_2_5_vl.md`](https://github.com/roboflow/maestro/blob/develop/docs/models/qwen_2_5_vl.md).
