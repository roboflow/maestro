## 👋 hello

Multimodal-Maestro gives you more control over large multimodal models to get the 
outputs you want. With more effective prompting tactics, you can get multimodal models 
to do tasks you didn't know (or think!) were possible. Curious how it works? Try our 
[HF space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Roboflow/SoM)!

## 💻 install

⚠️ Our package has been renamed to `maestro`. Install the package in a
[**3.11>=Python>=3.8**](https://www.python.org/) environment.

```bash
pip install maestro
```
